# The purpose of the project

Recentely, I am studying the [Algorithm from the University of Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome). 

There are some assignments for the course and here are my solutions. 

Note that the repo is only for reference and inspiration. Please do not use for the cheating.
